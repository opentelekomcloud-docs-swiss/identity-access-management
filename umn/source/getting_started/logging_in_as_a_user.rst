Logging In as a User
====================

You can log in to the cloud system as a user and access cloud services based on granted permissions.

Context
-------

Verify the information displayed on the **Login Verification** page during login if any of the following settings has been configured:

-  **Recent Login Information**: enabled on the **Login Authentication Policy** page
-  **Custom Information**: set on the **Login Authentication Policy** page
-  **Login Authentication**: enabled on the **My Credentials** page

Procedure
---------

#. Go to the login page.

#. Enter **Domain name**, **Username/Email address/Mobile number**, and **Password**, and click **Log In**.

   .. note::

      -  **Domain Name** is set when you register. **Username** is the name of a user created in IAM.
      -  If this is your first login, change your initial password on the **First Login** page. To ensure account security, change your password periodically.
      -  Enter a verification code on the **Login Verification** page if login authentication has been enabled.

   If the login is successful, the management console is displayed.
